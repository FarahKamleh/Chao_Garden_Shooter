# CS426_Kamleh_Farah_Asgn1
 A simple ball-throwing game, Assignment #1 loosely follows the theme of "what home means to you".

With an emphasis on the word "loosely", home in the case of this project refers to memory and nostalgia. Although fictional, spending enough time in another world can make it feel like home. Inspired by the Chao Gardens of Sonic Adventure 2 (2001), the objective of the game is to feed five neutral chao yellow fruits that are endlessly spawned by the player. Developed using free-to-use assets, all credits are included in the text file titled "CS 426 - Assignment 1 - Credits.txt". The C# scripts Target.cs, Score.cs, and PlayerMovement.cs are all modified versions of the starter code provided by the teaching assistant.
