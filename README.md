# CS426_Kamleh_Farah_Asgn1
 A simple ball-throwing game, Assignment #1 loosely follows the theme of "what home means to you".

With an emphasis on the word "loosely", home in the case of this project refers to memory and nostalgia. Inspired by the Chao Gardens of Sonic Adventure 2 (2001), the objective of the game is to feed five neutral chao yellow fruits that are endlessly spawned by the player. Developed using free-to-use resources, all credits are included in the text file titled "CS 426 - Assignment 1 - Credits".
